# Requirements

You'll need Xamarin Android SDK to get this running. I use arch, btw, so I got it from AUR (thanks to the `xamarin-android` guys).

## Other comments

I don't know nuthin about .NET, Monogame, F# or even Android, for that matter. I created this in an attempt to learn all of those.

I hacked around until stuff worked, which is definitely not what a pro would do. Please tell me if I did something stupid.
